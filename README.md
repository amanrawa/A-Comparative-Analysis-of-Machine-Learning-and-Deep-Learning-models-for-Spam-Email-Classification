A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for Spam Email Classification
 This report presents a comparative analysis of selected
 Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for spam email classification.
 The methodology involved comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing
 values and duplicates, merging disparate datasets, and applying distinct text vectorization techniques for ML (TF-IDF) and DL (tokenization and sequence padding). Five
 classification models were evaluated: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) from the ML paradigm, and Long Short-Term
 Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks from the DL paradigm.
 Experimental results demonstrate that while both ML and DL models achieve high accu
racy in spam classification, their performance profiles vary. The Support Vector Classifier
 (SVC) emerged as the best-performing model with an F1-score of 0.9261, indicating a
 strong balance between precision and recall. The GRU and LSTM models followed closely
 with F1-scores of 0.9219 and 0.9207, respectively. Random Forest exhibited exception
ally high precision (0.9970), signifying its effectiveness in minimizing false positives
